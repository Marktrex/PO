## Prompt engineering indicating all tables
- copy paste the text below to show the tables to gpt or copilot
```
I created a database for my application.
I have 6 tables:
- Group Type
- TransactionType_DE
- AccountType
- Ledger
- Ledger Transaction
- Request Expense

```


### Salary

- Salaries are recorded only as salaries. Tax expenses will not be included but is somehow included
- sample:

Salary expense(debit) - 100
Cash - 80 credit
Tax payable - 20 credit


-> Tax payable will be seen in cash flow
